# A vanilla Merge Sort implementation

This is jsut a simple merge sort implementation written in C++ for my own amusement. 
It can do 100,000,000 numbers in around 22 seconds, but it is not heavily optimized.

# To Use
To use this program, just compile the main.cpp and run it as a CLI program. 
It will ask for the length of the list to be sorted, just input a number. 
If the length is sufficiently small it will produce the sorted list so you can verify it works.
It also produces timing output, regardless of the size. 

Enjoy!
